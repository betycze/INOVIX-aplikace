The trajectory documents an extensive, iterative development process for the INOVIX Customer Portal, a bilingual (Czech/English) application. The work was driven by a series of detailed user requests, primarily in Czech. I must continue to communicate in Czech.

The initial phase involved implementing a complete Christmas Mode theme. This included adding a header image with a gradient, a Santa hat on the logo, a falling snow effect (later replaced with a more subtle bokeh effect), a glowing progress bar, and micro-icons on buttons. A significant portion of this phase was dedicated to debugging an unwanted glow effect around the logo, which was traced to a mispositioned particle from the background effect. This was resolved by constraining the effect to the screen corners and ultimately removing it to ensure the logo was clean.

The next major feature was the creation of the INOVIX Quiz Arena, a complex, Kahoot-style quiz game. This required new backend endpoints in  for storing scores and a new frontend screen, , with logic for questions, timers, results, and a leaderboard. This feature underwent multiple refinements: UI polishing, adding a skip button, localizing the entire quiz into English, and adding a feature to request an Instagram handle from top-3 players.

A recurring and critical task was updating the product catalog. This involved a frustrating debugging cycle related to server-side caching, which prevented new images from appearing for the user. The issue was definitively solved by systematically clearing the image directory, re-uploading the correct assets, and restarting both frontend and backend services.

The final task involved a user request to fix the admin panel, as deleting individual quiz scores was not working. I correctly diagnosed that the required  endpoint was missing in the backend. The work stopped just before implementing this fix.

The next agent must respond in Czech.

<product_requirements>
The INOVIX Customer Portal is a bilingual (Czech/English) Expo web application designed for a business fair. It features a dark theme with yellow accents (, ).

**Core Features:**
*   **Welcome Screen:** Features a full Christmas Mode design, including a header image with lights, an animated logo with a Santa hat, a subtle background bokeh effect, and a glowing progress bar under the countdown timer. Navigation to all app sections is provided.
*   **Product Catalog:** A swipe-based image gallery displaying 9 pages of products. It includes navigation buttons and an animated Return to Start button. The images are served from the backend and were the subject of several updates.
*   **INOVIX Quiz Arena:** A comprehensive, Kahoot-style quiz game. It is fully bilingual (CZ/EN) and includes:
    *   15 questions with a 15-second timer per question.
    *   A skip question option.
    *   Post-quiz statistics (score, time, comparison to median).
    *   A Top-10 leaderboard.
    *   A feature to ask for a user's Instagram handle if they place in the Top 3.
*   **Admin Panel ():** A Czech-language dashboard with a tabbed interface to view and delete all submitted booth ratings and quiz scores. It supports both individual and bulk deletion.
*   **Feedback Form & FAQ:** Standard sections for user feedback and frequently asked questions.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, MongoDB database.
- **Routing:** File-based routing with .
- **State Management:** React Context API for localization ().
- **UI & Animation:**  and standard  API for various effects (pulsating text, fade-in),  for gradients.
- **Backend API:** RESTful API for CRUD operations on ratings and quiz scores (including leaderboard stats) and serving static catalog images.
- **Debugging:** Resolved critical issues with frontend asset caching and component-level style conflicts (e.g., the glow effect).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  and  directories. The frontend is an Expo app with file-based routing in the  directory. The backend is a single-file FastAPI server.



- ****
    - **Importance:** The single source of truth for all API logic and database interaction.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Heavily modified to support the Quiz Arena. New Pydantic models (, ) and several endpoints were added:  to submit scores (including an optional  field),  for the top 10, and  for aggregate data. The endpoint for catalog images () was updated to find both  and  files. The logic to delete all quiz scores exists, but the logic to delete a *single* score is missing.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the most complex frontend component, containing the entire Kahoot-style quiz game.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch, it manages multiple screens internally (, , , , , ). It was made fully bilingual by integrating  and a local translation dictionary. The UI was significantly polished, replacing emojis with , improving the timer's appearance, and moving the skip button to a less intrusive position. Logic was added to conditionally display an Instagram input for Top-3 finishers.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The application's home screen.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Completely overhauled to implement the Christmas Mode theme. It now integrates several new components (, , ) and uses the Santa-hat version of the logo. The Christmas-themed micro-icons on the navigation buttons were added and later removed per user request.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the product catalog.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The underlying static image assets in  were repeatedly deleted and replaced, which caused significant caching issues that required full service restarts to resolve. An animated Return to Start button was added, which appears with a fade-in animation when the user is not on the first page.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The new administrative dashboard.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created as a new file to provide a more robust and user-friendly admin interface. It features a tabbed layout to separate Ratings and Quiz Results and includes functionality to call DELETE endpoints for clearing data. The button to delete individual quiz results is present but non-functional due to the missing backend endpoint.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Admin Panel:** The user reported that deleting individual quiz results does not work. The backend is missing the required API endpoint.
- **Verify Final Admin Panel Fix:** After implementing the backend fix, the entire deletion flow on the  page must be tested to confirm it works as expected.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to address a bug reported by the user: the inability to delete individual records from the INOVIX Quiz Arena section of the new admin page ().

I correctly diagnosed that while the frontend button exists to trigger this action, the corresponding backend API endpoint is missing. The  file has endpoints for deleting *all* quiz scores () and for deleting individual ratings, but it lacks an endpoint to delete a single quiz score by its ID (e.g., ).

The last action performed was identifying this gap in the backend logic, and the next step was planned to be the implementation of this missing  endpoint in .
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Add the missing  endpoint to  to allow for the deletion of individual quiz results.

**User:** nejdou mazat data pro INOVIX Quiz Arenu v admin stránce (Data for the INOVIX Quiz Arena cannot be deleted on the admin page)

**AI Engineer's last thought:** Rozumím! Problém je, že backend nemá endpoint pro mazání jednotlivých Quiz Arena výsledků. Opravím to! **Krok 1: Přidám DELETE endpointy do backendu** (I understand! The problem is that the backend doesn't have an endpoint to delete individual Quiz Arena results. I will fix it! **Step 1: I will add DELETE endpoints to the backend**)
