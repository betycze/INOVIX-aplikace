The trajectory documents the iterative development of the INOVIX Customer Portal, a bilingual (Czech/English) Expo application with a FastAPI backend. The initial phase focused on building the core features: a welcome screen with a live clock and countdown, a PDF catalog viewer, a feedback form, and an FAQ section, all styled with a dark theme and yellow accents.

Subsequent development was driven by user requests, leading to significant feature enhancements and refactoring. The static PDF catalog was replaced first with a problematic in-app PDF viewer, and then with a robust, custom image-based gallery served from the backend. A major feature, the INOVIX Quiz Arena, was added, including backend endpoints for storing scores and frontend UI for the quiz flow and results screen.

An admin dashboard was created at  to provide a view of user feedback and quiz statistics. This was later augmented with functionality to delete individual or all records.

Throughout the process, the AI engineer addressed numerous technical challenges, including React Native version mismatches, issues with platform-specific library compatibility (e.g.,  on the web), and fixing backend URL routing to correctly serve static assets through the Kubernetes ingress. The application's logo was also updated from a static image to an animated component, which required debugging SVG rendering issues before settling on a PNG-based animation. The final actions involved updating the countdown timer's logic and text based on a new user request.

<product_requirements>
The INOVIX Customer Portal is a bilingual (Czech/English) web application for business fair visitors, built with Expo and FastAPI.

**Core Features:**
*   **Welcome Screen:** Displays a live clock, a countdown to the fair's end date (currently set to Dec 4, 2025, 13:30 Prague time), the animated INOVIX logo, and navigation to other sections.
*   **Language Selection:** Toggles the entire UI between Czech (🇨🇿) and English (🇬🇧).
*   **Catalog Viewer:** An interactive, image-based viewer displaying catalog pages. It supports horizontal swiping, shows page numbers, and is populated by images uploaded to the backend.
*   **Rate Our Booth:** A feedback form with a 1-5 star rating, an optional comment, and a photo upload feature. Submissions are stored in a MongoDB database.
*   **FAQ Section:** A bilingual, accordion-style display of frequently asked questions.
*   **INOVIX Quiz Arena:** An interactive 10-question multiple-choice quiz on electronics. It shows the final score, a feedback message, and comparison to an average score.
*   **Admin Dashboard ():** A private page that displays all submitted ratings and quiz results. It includes a real-time clock and functionality to delete individual records or clear all data for both ratings and quizzes.

**Design:**
*   **Theme:** Dark background () with yellow accents ().
*   **Typography:** Montserrat font.
*   **Layout:** Modern, responsive, and clean UI optimized for tablets and smartphones.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, and MongoDB database.
- **Mobile/Web Development:** Expo for cross-platform development, using file-based routing with .
- **State Management:** React Context API () for localization.
- **Backend API:** RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on ratings and quiz scores, and for serving static catalog images.
- **UI/Animation:**  for animations (bouncing logo) and  for vector graphics.
- **Platform Handling:** Conditional rendering () to handle web vs. mobile differences, especially for the catalog viewer.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with distinct  and  directories. The frontend is an Expo app using file-based routing, while the backend is a Python FastAPI server.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the sole backend file, containing all API logic. It connects to MongoDB, defines data models for ratings and quiz scores, and exposes all API endpoints.
    - **Changes:** It was heavily modified to add endpoints for: fetching catalog images (), submitting/fetching/deleting ratings (), submitting/fetching/deleting quiz scores (, ), and serving static catalog images under an API-prefixed route () to work with the ingress. Database name was changed from hardcoded to an environment variable.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main entry point and home screen of the application. It contains the live clock, countdown timer, language switcher, and navigation buttons.
    - **Changes:** The countdown logic was updated multiple times to new target dates and timezones. The static logo was replaced with the  component. A new button for the INOVIX Quiz Arena was added. The most recent edit updated the countdown to target December 4, 2025, 13:30 Prague time and changed the label to Veletrh končí za.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the product catalog. It evolved from a simple PDF link to a fully interactive, image-based viewer.
    - **Changes:** This file was completely rewritten to fetch a list of image URLs from  and display them in a swipeable . It includes page navigation controls and a page counter. This replaced a problematic implementation that tried to use , which was incompatible with the web environment.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The administrative dashboard for viewing application data.
    - **Changes:** Created from scratch, it fetches and displays all ratings and quiz statistics. It was later enhanced with a real-time clock in the header and functions to send DELETE requests to the backend for clearing individual or all records from the quiz and feedback collections.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A reusable component for the animated INOVIX logo.
    - **Changes:** Created to encapsulate the logo animation logic. It initially used an SVG but was refactored to use a PNG image () with a  bouncing animation for better cross-platform compatibility after rendering issues. An extraneous glow effect was also removed per user request.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages the global language state (Czech/English) and provides translations for the entire app.
    - **Changes:** Updated multiple times to add new translations for the redesigned catalog, the quiz, and the admin pages.

<pending_tasks>
- Verify that all 8 newly uploaded catalog images are correctly displayed in order in the catalog viewer. The last 3 images were downloaded but the agent was interrupted before verification.
- Restart the Expo service to apply the latest countdown timer changes.
- Verify through a screenshot that the countdown timer on the main page correctly displays the countdown to 4. prosince 2025, 13:30 and shows the text Veletrh končí za.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was a direct request from the user to update the countdown timer. The user asked in Czech to change the timer to count down to **December 4, 2025, at 13:30 (Europe/Prague timezone)** and to change the label above it to **Veletrh končí za**.

To address this, the AI engineer performed three successive edits on the  file:
1.  Updated the  constant to  to reflect the new end time.
2.  Changed the text label in the JSX from  to a hardcoded .
3.  Updated the  function to use the new  and  for calculating the progress bar percentage.

The very last action taken was the thought to restart the Expo service to apply these changes. The restart command itself has not yet been executed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the Expo service, then take a screenshot of the home page to verify that the countdown timer is correctly updated as per the user's latest request.
